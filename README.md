## Description
This project introduces "TurnMosaic," a Python code designed to transform standard images into a visually mosaic artworks. By breaking an image into sections and replacing each section with a solid colors that represents the average color of that section. This effect can be applied to any photograph or image to create eye-catching results.

## Files
The file project.py will be this projects main code.
LakeView.png will be the provided original image that we will attempt to "turn mosaic".
Mosaiced_lakeView.JEPG will be the example of the finish product.

## Design Considerations
The project is designed to be simple and clear. Each function within the TurnMosaic class has a specific role, from loading and resizing images to creating the mosaic effect and saving the final product. This organization makes the code easy to understand and modify. The resizing function ensures that images are handled efficiently, maintaining performance regardless of their original size.

## Future Improvements
Add a way so that any image can be input by a user instead of only restricting it to one image.
