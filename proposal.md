## Challenges
- How to convert a file into a JPEG
- What kind of blur to implement
- How to effectively blur the right anount per image

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- An image that is blur in an equal interval of spaces to create a moasic.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Use an existing image and it turn into a good looking mosaic.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Create docstrings
  2. Break down what needs to be put into each function

- Week 2
  1. Write code for converting image
  2. Write code for resizing and blurring

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Record presentation
  2. Proper deliverables
